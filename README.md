# crypto-monitoring-consoleApp

  I've created a console app to understand how APIs and JSONS work. You can see the stats in Crypto Market by using simple commands on the console.
I have greater ideas on my mind about programming and cryptomarket, atuomating the progress of market analyzing via a mobile app would be a very nice project
for me to do. Now I'll try to learn mobile app development using Xamarin, after a few small projects I might try to do a mobile app version of this console app.
